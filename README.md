**`Game Dev (Programmer/Game Designer)`**

I`m Mori, a student currently pursuing a degree in Digital Games at Pontifical Catholic University (PUC). All my games have been fully developed from the ground up, from planning and designing the game mechanics all the way to programming them. I am proficient in various programming languages and game development tools, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
