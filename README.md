**`Game Dev (Programmer/Game Designer)`**

Iâ€™m Mori, i'm currently pursuing a career as a Game Designer or Programmer. Recently, I graduated in **`Digital Games at Pontifical Catholic University of SÃ£o Paulo (PUC-SP)`**. All my games have been fully developed from the ground up, from planning and designing game mechanics to programming them. I am proficient in various programming languages such as **`C#, C++ and Lua`** and game development tools **`Unity, Unreal and Godot`**, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field
